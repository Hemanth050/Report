At the end of each month total loyalty points are alloted to all the players. Out of which the top 50 players are provided cash benefits."	*/

After calculating the loyalty points for the whole month find out which 50 players are at the top of the leaderboard. The company has allocated a pool of Rs 50000 to be given away as bonus money to the loyal players.

Now the company needs to determine how much bonus money should be given to the players.

Should they base it on the amount of loyalty points? Should it be based on number of games? Or something else?

Thatâ€™s for you to figure out.

Suggest a suitable way to divide the allocated money keeping in mind the following points:

/*Part C

Would you say the loyalty point formula is fair or unfair?

Can you suggest any way to make the loyalty point formula more robust?"	*/																	

 Use net deposit: reward (deposit - withdrawal)

 Add engagement: include active days

Cap extreme values: avoid big outlier impact

 Balance weights: slightly increase games played weight
 Loyalty = 0.008 * (deposit - withdrawal) + 
          0.001 * (deposit_count - withdraw_count) + 
          0.15 * games_played + 
          0.1 * active_days
